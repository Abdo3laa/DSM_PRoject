Walmart Sales Data Analysis:

This project involves comprehensive preprocessing, visualization, and analysis of the Walmart Sales dataset. The goal is to gain insights into sales patterns, identify top-performing stores, and understand the impact of holidays on sales. Below is a detailed description of the tasks performed:

1. Data Preprocessing
Loading Data: Import the dataset into a pandas DataFrame.
Handling Missing Values: Identify and handle any missing or null values.
Data Transformation: Convert data types where necessary (e.g., dates, numerical values).
Feature Engineering: Create new features to aid in analysis, such as calculating sales per square foot.
Outlier Detection: Identify and handle outliers in the sales data to ensure accurate analysis.
2. Data Visualization
Sales Distribution: Visualize the distribution of sales across different stores using histograms and box plots.
Time Series Analysis: Plot time series graphs to analyze sales trends over time.
Holiday Impact: Use bar charts to compare sales during holiday and non-holiday periods.
Store Performance: Create visualizations to compare the performance of different stores.
3. Analytical Outputs
A. Store with Maximum Sales
Objective: Identify the store with the highest total sales.
Method: Sum the sales for each store and find the maximum.
Output: Store ID and total sales amount.
B. Store with Maximum Standard Deviation in Sales
Objective: Identify the store with the highest variability in sales.
Method: Calculate the standard deviation of sales for each store and find the maximum.
Output: Store ID and standard deviation value.
C. Holidays with Sales Higher than Overall Mean Sales in the Non-Holiday Season
Objective: Determine which holidays have sales exceeding the average sales during non-holiday periods.
Method: Calculate the mean sales during non-holiday periods and compare it to sales during holidays.
Output: List of holidays with sales figures.
D. Monthly View of Sales
Objective: Provide a month-by-month breakdown of sales.
Method: Aggregate sales data by month.
Output: Monthly sales figures and visualizations (e.g., line charts).
E. Semester View of Sales
Objective: Provide a semester-by-semester breakdown of sales.
Method: Aggregate sales data by six-month periods.
Output: Semester sales figures and visualizations (e.g., bar charts).
